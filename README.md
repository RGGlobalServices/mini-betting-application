# Mini Bettor

A clean, production-ready mini betting application.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (icons), Motion (animations)
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express, TSX
*   **Database:** MongoDB (with an in-memory fallback if no connection string is provided)

## Features

### Frontend UI
*   Clean, modern interface with a dark theme.
*   Input field to enter the bet amount.
*   "Place Bet" button.
*   Displays updated balance and Win/Loss result with floating text animations.
*   "Half" and "Max" bet quick-action buttons.
*   Wallet top-up feature allowing users to add balance locally/remotely.
*   Loading state and disable the button while placing a bet.
*   Input validation (no negative bets, handles insufficient funds).

### Backend APIs
*   `GET /api/balance`: Returns the user's current balance.
*   `POST /api/place-bet`: Accepts a bet amount, validates it, and calculates a 50/50 win/loss outcome. Deducts the bet or adds the winnings accordingly.
*   `POST /api/add-balance`: Allows users to add deposit amounts to their wallet balance.

### Business Logic
*   Initial balance is set to **100 USD**.
*   When winning, the bet amount is added to the balance (essentially keeping the bet and gaining an equal amount).
*   Data is stored in MongoDB using Mongoose. If no `MONGODB_URI` environment variable is available, the app falls back to an in-memory state so it still functions in preview modes.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the root directory:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and add your MongoDB connection string (optional - the app will work in memory without it):
```env
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/mini-bettor"
```

### 3. Run the Application

This is a full-stack application configured to run both the frontend and backend simultaneously through Express.

To start the development server (Backend + Vite Frontend Middleware):
```bash
npm run dev
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

### 4. Production Build

To build the project for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

To start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```
